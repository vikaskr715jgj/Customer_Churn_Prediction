# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## 📜 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior and building a **predictive model** to identify customers likely to churn. By understanding the factors that influence churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

**The project involves:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
- Handling imbalanced data using **SMOTE**
- Building a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction
- Visualizing insights for decision-making
